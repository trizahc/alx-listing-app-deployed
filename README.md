This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

# ALX Listing App

ALX Listing App is a simplified Airbnb clone built with Next.js. The goal of this project is to create a modern, responsive listing page that allows users to view and interact with property listings. This app is part of a hands-on learning initiative in the ALX Software Engineering program, focusing on practical application of full-stack web development skills.

## üöÄ Features

- View property listings with images and details
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop
- Modular and scalable project architecture
- Built with modern React and Next.js best practices

## üìÅ Project Structure

The project is organized into the following key directories:

- **`components/`**  
  Contains reusable React components such as `ListingCard`, `Navbar`, `Footer`, and layout structures used across the app.

- **`interfaces/`**  
  Holds TypeScript interfaces and types that define the structure of data used in the application, such as `Listing` or `User`.

- **`constants/`**  
  Stores configuration files, static data, or constants (e.g., filter options, category names, or URLs) used throughout the app.

- **`public/assets/`**
